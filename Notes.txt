How to get started:

There are several ways to Run MagScope
you can import it to a notebook or run a main file in an editor like PyCharm or VSCode
	import magscope
	
	scope = magscope.Scope
	scope.start()

Setup your own camera
Test the camera
Run MagScope with the camera

	import magscope
	
	scope = magscope.Scope
	scope.camera = myCustomCamera
	scope.start()

Setup your own fine z-motor (such a pizeo motor you use to make a zlut)
